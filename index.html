    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Riche Mcaw:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1980</strong> - Born in Oamaru, New Zealand</li>
        <li>
          <strong>2002–2003</strong> - In the lead-up to the 2003 World Cup 
          McCaw was a regular player for Canterbury, the Crusaders and the All Blacks. 
          In 2002 and 2003 the Crusaders competed in the Super Rugby final, beating the Brumbies in 2002
          and losing to the Blues in 2003. The Canterbury provincial rugby team lost the semi final
          to the eventual winners Auckland in 2002. McCaw and the other All Blacks were "rested"
          during the 2003 national provincial championship.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2004–2005</strong> - The Crusaders finished as runner-ups in the 2004 Super 12 season,
          losing the final to the Brumbies. Following the World Cup, John Mitchell was dropped as All
          Black coach and replaced by Graham Henry. McCaw was selected as first choice openside flanker
          and made vice captain. In the first test against England he was escorted off the field after 
          suffering concussion following a clash of heads with fellow All Black Xavier Rush. He was a 
          late withdrawal from the second England test and then played 70 minutes against Argentina 
          before again leaving the field due to dizziness. Still suffering headaches a month later, 
          he withdrew from the rest of the home campaign and the 2004 Tri Nations to focus on recovery. 
          McCaw returned to captain Canterbury to the finals at the tail end of the NPC season. In 
          November 2004 he returned for the All Blacks' end-of-season tour to Italy, Wales and France. He was 
          made captain at the age of 23 for the first time against Wales as regular captain Tana Umaga 
          was rested.
          In April 2005, while captaining the Crusaders, McCaw again suffered a concussion. He was stretchered
          off the field two minutes into the game after attempting a tackle on Bulls prop Richard Bands. After
          the incident, McCaw visited a young boy in hospital who had broken his neck playing rugby and started
          to question whether he should be playing the game. Another paraplegic in the ward told him he had
          broken his neck swimming on holiday in Fiji, convincing McCaw that it could happen anywhere, and
          you may as well "do what you enjoy". A month later, in May 2005, McCaw returned to training
          with the Crusaders and led them in their semi-final and final victories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2006–2007</strong> - FMcCaw led the Crusaders to the Super Rugby title again in 2006.
          In May 2006, at the age of 25 and after 36 test matches, McCaw was named captain of the All Blacks.
          His first two games as regular captain were against Ireland in New Zealand, while a separate squad
          led by Jerry Collins was named to travel to Argentina for a one-off game.
          McCaw started his captaincy with victory over Ireland and then mentored stand-in captain Jerry Collins
          in Argentina. New Zealand emerged as 2006 Tri Nations champions (the only loss away to South Africa
          by one point) and retained the Bledisloe Cup. A successful European tour saw comfortable victories
          gainst England, France twice and Wales. McCaw was captain in every match and after being short
          listed in 2002, 2003 and 2005 was named the 2006 IRB International Player of the Year.Because 2007 was
          a World Cup year, All Black management decided that a select group of 22 players, including McCaw,
          would undergo "reconditioning" by not playing in the first seven rounds of the Super 14. McCaw
          returned to the Crusaders in the eighth round and helped them reach the semi-finals
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2007</strong> - The 2007 World Cup was held in France, Scotland and Wales. The All Blacks
          were in a pool that included Italy, Portugal, Scotland and Romania. The All Blacks comfortably 
          made it through the pool play with scores of 76–14, 108–13, 40–0 and 85–8 respectively. McCaw made 
          just three appearances (two starts and one as a reserve) due to Henry's rotation policy. In the 
          quarter-finals the All Blacks lost to France 18–20, resulting in New Zealand's earliest exit from a
          World Cup. With semi-final exits after being among the favourites at the 1991, 1999 and 2003 World 
          Cups, they were once again accused of "choking on the world's biggest stage".
          An emotional McCaw could not hide his disappointment at the after-match press conference: "If I knew the
          answers we would have sorted it out. We will be thinking about it for a long time". McCaw denied New
          Zealand's easy run into the quarter-finals played a part in the loss "A lot of the guys have been through
          this before, they've played big test matches. "Graham Henry's policy of using squad rotation and
          resting key players during the Super 14 was criticised. McCaw also came under attack. He was accused
          of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not
          providing enough leadership on the field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2008</strong> - Despite much speculation that Henry would lose the All Black coaching job to 
          coach Robbie Deans, he was retained on a contract for the next two years, later extended to include
          the 2011 World Cup. He immediately stated that he would retain McCaw as his captain. Robbie Deans
          instead signed with the Australian Rugby Union, becoming head coach of Australia. In Deans' last
          season (2008) as Crusaders coach they won the Super Rugby title for the seventh time. Ireland
          and England toured to New Zealand in June 2008 and the All Blacks came away with a hard-fought
          in against Ireland, and two comfortable victories against England. McCaw tore a ligament in his
          ankle against England and missed the start of the Tri Nations.
          McCaw finished 2008 by making his debut for the Barbarians against Australia at Twickenham in 
          an 11–18 loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2008</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
          Pathology
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2009–2010</strong> - The Crusaders, under new coach Todd Blackadder, had a slow start
          to the 2009 season, losing four of their first five games.
          The 2010 season started in much the same way with the Crusaders finishing fourth during the round robin 
          stage and losing to the Bulls in the semi-final.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2011</strong> - During preseason training in January 2011 McCaw injured his foot, subsequent
          x-rays revealed that he had received a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal of his right foot.
          It was determined his best chance of recovery was to undergo an operation where a pin was inserted.
          As a result, McCaw missed the opening two months of the Super Rugby season. During the
          All Black's third Rugby World Cup pool match against France, McCaw became the first All Black
          to reach 100 test caps. However, it was also during this match McCaw re-aggravated his
          foot injury. In order to rest his injury, he was forced to skip the more physical aspects
          of training and miss the All Blacks' final pool match against Canada. Prior to the Quarter-final 
          against Argentina McCaw decided against having another x-ray. Following the re-occurrence of his
          injury it was uncertain whether McCaw could continue to play for the All Blacks, this forced the
          coaching staff to develop contingency plans and Matt Todd was called into the All Black training
          squad. McCaw was able to continue to play throughout the World Cup tournament and lifted
          the Webb Ellis trophy after a tense 8–7 victory over France.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2012–2014</strong> - Under new coach Steve Hansen, the All Blacks won 12 tests, drew one
          and only lost one test in 2012, as well as winning the new Rugby Championship with a 100% winning record.
          During this time McCaw overtook George Gregan for most times on the winning side with 94. He also
          recorded his 100th win against South Africa in Dunedin. McCaw was a nominee for the IRB Player of
          the Year award but lost out to teammate Dan Carter.
          In the first half of 2013, in order to rest his body and improve his chances of playing in
          the 2015 Rugby World Cup McCaw enforced the sabbatical clause in his NZRFU contract. As a result,
          he only played the latter rounds of Super Rugby, and missed the 2013 French Test Series.
          He later returned to captain the All Blacks as they successfully defended the Rugby Championship.
          During this campaign, McCaw equalled (with Brian O'Driscoll of Ireland and John Smit of
          South Africa) the record as captaining the most test matches (83). McCaw subsequently overtook
          this record when playing in Japan on 2 November 2013. Following the All Blacks victory over
          the Springboks in Ellis Park, McCaw has played and won at every major Rugby Test stadium. 
          Along with Kieran Read, McCaw led the All Blacks to a perfect season in 2013, winning 14 out
          of 14.
          McCaw captained New Zealand for the 100th time on 22 November 2014 in the end of year international
          against Wales. He is the first rugby union player to achieve 100 caps as captain. On 15
          August 2015, McCaw surpassed Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll world record, as the most capped rugby
          player when he won his 142nd cap against Australia in the Bledisloe Cup. He would go on to 
          hold this title for five years until 31 October 2020 when Welsh captain Alun Wyn Jones got his
          149th cap.
          On 31 October 2015, McCaw captained New Zealand to retain the Rugby World Cup after a 34–17 win
          against Australia in the final at Twickenham. During the tournament he received a yellow
          card for foottripping in the opening game against Argentina. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2015</strong> - On 19 November 2015, McCaw 
          announced his retirement from rugby.
